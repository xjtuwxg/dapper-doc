Welcome to Dapper's documentation!
===================================

**Dapper** is a `CRIU <https://criu.org/Main_Page>`_ extension that transforms
the CRIU image between different architectures. It allows *live process migration*
between an x86 machine node and an ARM machine node.

Check the :doc:`install` page for installation, and the :doc`usage` page for how
to use **Dapper** to migrate a process across the architecture boundary.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
